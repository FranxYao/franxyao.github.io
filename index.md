My name is Yao Fu 符尧

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh (2020-) with Prof. [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) doing semantic parsing. 
I finished my M.S. at Columbia University (2018-2020) with Prof. [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) doing deep generative models and my B.S. at Peking University (2013-2018) with Prof. [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home) doing text generation. Before Ph.D., I spent great time visiting Prof. [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) at Cornell University (2019-2020) doing structured latent variable models. 


I study learning problems rooted from human language, particularly generation and structured prediction. I derive probabilistic models guided by Bayesian principles, equipped with modern neural architectures, utilizing efficient inference, and grounded to linguistics and real-world scenarios. 

In terms of specific topics, I am interested in 
* NLP: Semantics; Text Generation; Linguistic Structure Prediction
* ML: Generalization; Deep Generative Models; Discrete Latent Structures 

Many topics that I'm interested in are covered by the following reading list:
* Deep Generative Models for Natural Language Processing. ([github](https://github.com/franxyao/Deep-Generative-Models-for-Natural-Language-Processing))
* Compositional Generalization in Natural Language Processing. ([github](https://github.com/FranxYao/Compositional-Generalization-in-Natural-Language-Processing))
